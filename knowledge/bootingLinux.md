# Installing Ubuntu Linux on a Windows XPS 13 Laptop

To remove Windows and install Ubuntu Linux on a computer, you can follow these steps:

1. Backup your data: Before starting the process, make sure to backup all your important data, files, and documents as the installation process will erase everything on the hard drive.

2. Download Ubuntu: Visit the official website of Ubuntu and download the latest version of the operating system. You can also choose to download Ubuntu from other sources, but make sure to download it from a reputable source.

3. Create a bootable USB drive: After downloading the Ubuntu ISO file, you'll need to create a bootable USB drive to install Ubuntu. You can use a tool like Rufus to create the bootable drive.

4. Boot from the USB drive: Insert the bootable USB drive into your computer and restart your machine. As it starts, press the key to enter the BIOS or UEFI setup, and set your computer to boot from the USB drive.

5. Install Ubuntu: Once your computer boots from the USB drive, you'll see the Ubuntu installer. Follow the instructions to install Ubuntu. You'll be asked to select the language, keyboard layout, time zone, and create a user account. Make sure to select "Erase disk and install Ubuntu" to remove Windows and install Ubuntu.

6. Wait for the installation to complete: The installation process may take some time, depending on the speed of your computer. Once the installation is complete, restart your computer and log in to your new Ubuntu operating system.

7. Update and upgrade: After logging in, update the system and upgrade to the latest version of Ubuntu by running the following command in the terminal:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```

That's about it! We have installed Ubuntu Linux on the laptop and removed Windows.

## Bootable USB Drive

You can use any USB drive with a minimum capacity of 4 GB to create a bootable drive to install Ubuntu. However, it's recommended to use a USB drive with at least 8 GB of storage to ensure that you have enough space to store the operating system and any additional software you may want to install.

Keep in mind that if you plan to use the USB drive for other purposes in the future, the contents of the drive will be deleted during the creation of the bootable drive. So, make sure to backup any important files before proceeding with the process.
