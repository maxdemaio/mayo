## Host, Anonymous, and Named Docker Volumes

https://spin.atomicobject.com/2019/07/11/docker-volumes-explained/

**Host volumes**

A host volume can be accessed from within a Docker container and is stored on the host. To create a host volume, run:

```
docker run -v /path/on/host:/path/in/container
```

**Anonymous volumes**

The location of anonymous volumes is managed by Docker. It can be difficult to refer to the same volume when it is anonymous. To create an anonymous volume, run:

```
docker run -v /path/in/container
```

Anonymous volumes provide flexibility, but they arenâ€™t used as often now that named volumes have been introduced.

**Named volumes**

Named volumes and anonymous volumes are similar because Docker manages where they are located. But, named volumes can be referred to by names. To create a named volume, run:

```
docker volume create somevolumename
docker run -v somevolumename:/path/in/container
```

Like anonymous volumes, named volumes provide flexibility, but they are also explicit. This makes them easier to manage.

You can also specify Docker volumes in your docker-compose.yaml file using the same syntax as the examples above.
